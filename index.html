  [{"title":"Discipline at Jefferson Middle: Suspensions and “Defiance”","setting_snapshot":"Jefferson Middle School is a large, majority-Black public school in an urban district. The building is old, some classroom windows are painted shut, and the heaters rattle in winter. Hallways are crowded during every class change. The school has one full-time social worker, a part-time behavior specialist shared with another campus, and a school resource officer (SRO) assigned three days a week.","population_snapshot":"Most students live within a 3–4 mile radius. Many caregivers work variable shifts in healthcare, service, or warehouse jobs. About 80% of students qualify for free/reduced lunch. The “high needs” roster combines students with IEPs, 504 plans, and those with 5+ office referrals; Black students and students with disabilities are overrepresented on that list and in suspension data.","core_problems":"Over the past two years, Jefferson’s out-of-school suspensions have climbed overall and are now above the district average. The largest categories are “defiance,” “disruption,” and “noncompliance.” Teachers describe write-ups for refusing to put away phones, walking out of class, and hallway conflicts that escalate into suspensions. The social worker is called often to de-escalate student-teacher conflicts. Many frequent flyers have recent stressors (housing changes, caregiver illness, community violence) that rarely appear in discipline records. Teachers report burnout and say “nothing works,” while families express frustration about fairness and communication. The district flagged Jefferson for disproportionate discipline and demanded a plan.","stakeholder_glimpses":"Principal: Wants to reduce suspensions without alienating staff and to address disproportionality; fears teacher turnover.\nTeachers: Mixed views, with some wanting “clear consequences” and others asking for more support, coaching, and consistency.\nStudents: Report feeling targeted or misunderstood; some avoid school due to “drama” and adult interactions.\nFamilies: Mixed trust in the school; some feel meetings are for “being told,” not problem-solving together.\nDistrict leaders: Watch suspension numbers, disproportionality, attendance, and school climate as key metrics; also attuned to legal risk.","equity_signals":"Racial and disability disparities in referrals and suspensions; vague categories rely on adult interpretation; police presence on campus; limited youth-friendly mental health services; accountability pressures that value “order” and test scores over relationship-building.","constraints_resources":"Limited space for new programs; one social worker and a part-time behavior specialist; an SRO is on campus three days/week. Mandatory PD hours are already packed. There is a small, one-year “innovation” grant up to $10,000. A local youth nonprofit is interested in partnering but not yet formally connected.","role":"As the MSW social worker/evaluator, propose a specific, realistic practice change and outline how you will evaluate whether it helps."},
{"title":"Discharge to Nowhere: Unhoused Patients at City General","setting_snapshot":"City General is a busy safety-net hospital. Social workers juggle crisis consults and discharge planning. The ED hallways are often lined with stretchers waiting for beds. Units are short-staffed at times, and weekends are especially tight.","population_snapshot":"Many adult inpatients are unhoused or precariously housed. Co-occurring chronic illnesses, mental health diagnoses, and substance use are common. Some patients have probation requirements or lack identification and documents needed for services.","core_problems":"Thirty-day readmissions for unhoused patients are nearly double those of housed patients. Staff see familiar faces returning within weeks. Patients report rushed, confusing discharges and unsafe post-discharge conditions. Staff feel pressured to move people out quickly. Social workers describe “moral distress” with limited placement options and time to coordinate with community resources.","stakeholder_glimpses":"Hospital leadership / risk management: Concerned about readmission penalties and ED throughput.\nMedical staff: Want fewer bounce-backs and safer, realistic discharges.\nSocial work / case management: Overextended; want time to coordinate resources.\nPatients: Want respect and plans that fit their reality.\nCommunity partners: At capacity; feel the hospital “dumps” people on them without coordination.","equity_signals":"Criminalization of homelessness (loitering, trespassing); racialized patterns in who becomes and remains unhoused; insurance gaps; lack of medical respite; policy incentives that prioritize rapid discharge over continuity and relationship.","constraints_resources":"No capacity to create a new inpatient unit. Limited motel vouchers. Must work within current staffing. EHR can track readmissions and ED visits. One FQHC and a shelter are open to coordination. Leadership is open to a small, targeted pilot.","role":"Design a small-scale discharge planning program or practice tweak for unhoused patients and outline an evaluation of outcomes and experiences."},
{"title":"We Don't Feel Safe Here: LGBTQ+ Students at Northside High","setting_snapshot":"Northside High is a suburban campus spread across multiple buildings. There is one counselor, a shared social worker across two schools, and no recognized GSA. Student clubs meet at lunch or after school depending on room availability.","population_snapshot":"Student body is majority White with a growing number of Black, Latine, and immigrant students. There is a visible group of queer and trans students who cluster in certain teacher rooms and outdoor areas they perceive as safer.","core_problems":"Reports of bullying and harassment, including social media incidents, have increased. Staff responses vary—some are supportive, others minimize concerns or avoid involvement. Admin sends generic anti-bullying emails but has not adopted specific LGBTQ+ policies or training. Students avoid certain bathrooms and hallways and sometimes avoid school entirely.","stakeholder_glimpses":"LGBTQ+ students: Want basic safety, correct names/pronouns, and adults who intervene.\nOther students: Range from bullying to quietly supportive.\nStaff: Desire tools, consistent admin backing, and clarity; fear community backlash.\nAdministration: Wants fewer reports and lower controversy.\nFamilies: Mixed views influenced by beliefs and experiences.","equity_signals":"State-level debates on LGBTQ+ issues; intersection with race, disability, and immigration; absence of explicit protections; variation in staff beliefs and training.","constraints_resources":"Limited PD time. No dedicated LGBTQ+ budget or staff. An informal lunch group exists. A local LGBTQ+ youth center is willing to partner. The anti-bullying policy is general and lacks implementation guidance specific to LGBTQ+ students.","role":"Propose a specific program/practice to improve safety and belonging and design an evaluation to understand impact."},
{"title":"Lost in Translation: Newcomer Students at Eastview Middle","setting_snapshot":"Eastview Middle is a mid-sized city school with one ESOL teacher and part-time interpreter services by phone/video. Parent nights have high turnout but limited language access.","population_snapshot":"About 30% of students are multilingual learners. Recent newcomers include students from Central America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Some have significant gaps in schooling or trauma histories.","core_problems":"Some students show quiet compliance while failing assessments; others act out or skip class. Family communications from school are often in English only. Students are sometimes placed into lower-level courses based on English level rather than prior knowledge. IEP referrals happen without full cultural and linguistic consideration.","stakeholder_glimpses":"Students: Want friends, understanding, and support.\nFamilies: Want their children to succeed but may fear systems.\nTeachers: Want to adapt instruction but have limited time and training.\nAdministrators: Focused on accountability metrics and placement targets.","equity_signals":"Language barriers and inadequate interpretation; immigration status and trauma; tracking into lower coursework; English-only metrics of success and “readiness.”","constraints_resources":"Limited ESOL hours. Interpreter services require planning. Resettlement agency has evening programs. A small grant is possible, but no new full-time positions are promised.","role":"Design a support program/practice for newcomer/multilingual students and families and outline an evaluation on access, experience, and outcomes."},
{"title":"Always Waiting: College Counseling Center at River State University","setting_snapshot":"RSU’s counseling center includes psychologists, social workers, and trainees. It has a reputation among students for being overbooked and hard to access quickly.","population_snapshot":"Students are diverse and include many first-gen students balancing work and school. Presenting concerns include anxiety, depression, trauma, family conflict, substance use, and academic performance.","core_problems":"Waits for intake have reached 3–4 weeks, with some students never making it past the waitlist. Staff report burnout. Students complain about delays and having to retell their story multiple times.","stakeholder_glimpses":"Students: Want timely, culturally responsive support.\nStaff: Want to provide quality care without burnout.\nAdministration: Wants improved access and optics.\nFaculty: Want clear referral pathways and guidance.","equity_signals":"First-gen and low-income stress; stigma and mistrust of services; representation gaps among providers; insurance barriers to off-campus referrals.","constraints_resources":"Limited space; potential to reconfigure scheduling, workshops, and stepped care; some pilot funding tied to reducing wait times; relationships with off-campus providers exist.","role":"Propose a concrete program/practice change (e.g., brief track, workshops, triage protocol) and design an evaluation for access, experience, and outcomes."},
{"title":"We're Just a Bed, Not a Solution: DV Shelter Survivors Program","setting_snapshot":"Safe Harbor House is a confidential emergency shelter with 18 beds, two case managers, a children’s advocate, and a part-time clinical social worker.","population_snapshot":"Residents are mostly women and children from a mix of racial and cultural backgrounds; some are undocumented. Typical stays are 30–60 days.","core_problems":"Residents cycle through quickly; some return to partners soon after leaving. Survivors juggle court, jobs, school, and trauma while managing childcare. Groups are loosely structured with variable participation, and it is unclear which services help most.","stakeholder_glimpses":"Residents: Want safety, non-judgment, and practical help.\nStaff: Seek structure without rigidity; want to see meaning in efforts.\nBoard/funders: Want evidence of effectiveness.\nPartners: Sometimes hold narrow outcome views (e.g., permanent separation).","equity_signals":"Economic dependence and immigration fears; trauma-uninformed systems; racism and stereotypes about who is believed and supported.","constraints_resources":"Limited staff and no on-site childcare. Some grant flexibility exists. Basic data are tracked, but there are no standardized measures across services.","role":"Design a structured program component (group, individualized track, follow-up outreach) and plan an evaluation for survivor experience and key outcomes."},
{"title":"A Roof, Not a Home: Transitional Housing for Youth Aging Out of Care","setting_snapshot":"BridgePoint House consists of studio apartments with two case managers and a life skills coach.","population_snapshot":"Young adults 18–24 with histories of system involvement, trauma, and disrupted schooling; some are parents.","core_problems":"The program emphasizes housing stability more than wellbeing or connection. Residents report isolation, conflicts, early exits, and disengagement from services. Funders track exits to housing but not broader dimensions of wellbeing.","stakeholder_glimpses":"Residents: Want autonomy, respect, and support that is not surveillance.\nStaff: Need to build trust without rigid rules that backfire.\nFunders: Want measurable outcomes.\nCommunity partners: Unsure how best to engage residents.","equity_signals":"Systemic racism and classism; barriers for youth with records; lack of affordable housing; stigma toward youth who have been in care.","constraints_resources":"Limited 1:1 capacity; groups are more feasible. Small budget for stipends and activities. Program tracks length of stay and exit destination, but has little data on mental health or belonging.","role":"Design a program element (peer-led group, mentorship, coaching, partnered activity) and outline an evaluation of impact on youth experience and outcomes."},
{"title":"Productivity or People? Quotas at Community Family Services","setting_snapshot":"CFS provides outpatient therapy, case management, and parenting support to mostly Medicaid-insured families in a large metro area.","population_snapshot":"Families navigate poverty, housing instability, child welfare involvement, parental mental health/substance use, and IPV. Many are single parents or grandparents raising grandchildren.","core_problems":"Stricter productivity targets push shorter sessions and less coordination. Clients feel rushed; some disengage. Leadership worries about revenue but is open to targeted changes.","stakeholder_glimpses":"Clinicians: Want time for relational work and flexibility.\nSupervisors: Want to support staff while meeting budgets.\nExecutive/Board: Seek financial viability and retention.\nClients: Want to feel heard and have flexible options.","equity_signals":"Reimbursement systems reward billable hours over advocacy and coordination; impact falls hardest on families facing greater structural barriers; risk of pushing out client-centered staff.","constraints_resources":"Overall billables cannot drop dramatically. Pilots for subsets may be possible (e.g., scheduling templates, group + individual blends). EHR/billing data are available; basic satisfaction forms are used.","role":"Propose a targeted adjustment (pilot caseload/scheduling model, integrated group+individual, structured relational time) and design an evaluation for client experience and key metrics."},
{"title":"In and Out of the Room: Medically Complex Kids on the Pediatric Unit","setting_snapshot":"Memorial Children’s Hospital pediatric unit has semi-private rooms, a child life specialist, a social worker, and rotating residents and nurses.","population_snapshot":"Patients include infants through teens with complex conditions. Families are diverse; some travel from rural areas. A subset has child welfare involvement.","core_problems":"Clinicians worry about caregiver follow-through after discharge and repeated readmissions. Caregivers describe being overwhelmed by work, transportation, and health literacy demands. There is tension around child welfare involvement and equity concerns in when families are reported.","stakeholder_glimpses":"Caregivers: Want respectful, clear communication and support to care for their child at home.\nNurses/physicians: Want to know that home care will be safe and feasible.\nSocial worker: Wants to prevent unnecessary CPS involvement.\nChild welfare workers: Make safety assessments with limited time and information.\nHospital leadership: Tracks readmissions and quality metrics.","equity_signals":"Disparities in labeling families and in CPS reporting; language and health literacy barriers; limited home supports; policies that treat missed appointments as caregiver failure.","constraints_resources":"No new positions. Teaching materials exist but are not always plain-language or multilingual. A small grant could support caregiver engagement. EHR tracks readmissions and length of stay.","role":"Design a program/practice to support families (teaching protocols, peer support, discharge tweaks) and outline an evaluation of outcomes and experiences."},
{"title":"Out and Back Again: Youth Reentry Drop-In Center","setting_snapshot":"Horizon Hub is near a bus hub and courthouse and serves ages 16–24 on probation, recently released, or aging out of systems.","population_snapshot":"Mostly Black and Latine youth with histories of school exclusion, family instability, trauma; some are young parents. They juggle probation, jobs, court, and housing.","core_problems":"The Hub provides basics (showers, laundry, snacks) but lacks structured program offerings. Engagement is episodic. Funders and probation ask for outcomes, but the Hub has limited data and systems.","stakeholder_glimpses":"Youth: Want respect, practical help, and spaces that don’t feel like surveillance.\nStaff: Want to deepen services without mission drift.\nProbation: Wants proof of engagement and fewer violations.\nFunders/Board: Look for education, employment, and recidivism metrics.\nCommunity: Mixed perceptions of the Hub and youth it serves.","equity_signals":"School-to-prison pipeline and concentrated policing; tension between carceral logic and youth development; barriers to ID, employment, and housing.","constraints_resources":"Small staff and space; flexible multi-use room; grant requires documentation of services and outcomes. Partners include legal aid, community college, and employers.","role":"Design a realistic program track (e.g., planning series, peer-led groups, structured case management) and develop an evaluation for youth experience and reentry outcomes."},
{"title":"More Sirens at Night: Overdoses in the Riverside Neighborhood","setting_snapshot":"Riverside is a working-class neighborhood near an industrial corridor with visible public drug use and increased police presence.","population_snapshot":"Residents include long-term older Black and White neighbors and newer young renters. Many face job loss, health issues, and limited transportation. A portion of residents use opioids, sometimes publicly.","core_problems":"Overdoses and deaths have risen sharply over 18 months.

IEP Conflict at Lincoln Elementary","setting_snapshot":"Lincoln Elementary is a neighborhood K–5 with a resource room, speech office, small sensory space, a part-time school psychologist, and a shared social worker.","population_snapshot":"Families are diverse. Many caregivers are hourly workers. There is a noticeable number of students receiving special education services.","core_problems":"IEP meetings have become contentious. Families describe feeling outnumbered and rushed. Staff say they feel attacked. Examples include pressure toward restrictive placements and English-only drafts shared minutes before meetings.","stakeholder_glimpses":"Families: Want partnership and understandable language.\nTeachers: Want support for behavior and differentiation.\nSpecial education staff: Seek compliance and services under constraints.\nAdministrators: Want to avoid due process and manage burnout.\nStudents: Need to belong in their classrooms.","equity_signals":"Racial and disability disparities; power imbalances in meetings; language access; paperwork compliance prioritized over relationships.","constraints_resources":"Limited time for long meetings or pre-meetings.
